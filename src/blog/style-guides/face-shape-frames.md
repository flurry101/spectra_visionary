# Choosing the Perfect Frames for Your Face Shape

Selecting a new pair of glasses or sunglasses can be an exciting yet overwhelming experience. With countless styles, colors, sizes, and shapes available, where do you begin?

A great starting point is to consider your face shape. The right frame can highlight your best features and create a balanced, aesthetically pleasing look. However, remember that there are no strict rules for matching frames to face shapes; personal style, preferences, and comfort should always take precedence. Use these face shape tips as inspiration or to help you decide between a few pairs that catch your eye.

Not sure where to start? We’ve got you covered! This article will explore the main face shapes, the best frames for each, and other essential factors to consider when buying new glasses. These guidelines apply to all types of eyewear, from blue light glasses to readers to sunglasses.

## The 6 Main Face Shapes

Most faces can be categorized into six primary shapes: oval, round, square, heart, diamond, and triangle.

Keep in mind that many people’s faces may not fit neatly into one category. The goal is to identify the shape that most closely resembles yours, even if the features don’t match perfectly.

To help determine your face shape, focus on three key areas:

1. **Jawline**: Is it curved or angular?
2. **Forehead**: Is it wide or narrow?
3. **Cheekbones**: Are they soft or prominent?

With these considerations in mind, review the descriptions below to identify your face shape. Then, we’ll explore how to use that information to find frames that balance and complement your features.

## What Is My Face Shape?

By now, you should have a good idea of your general face shape. To confirm your initial impression, find a clear picture of yourself and compare it to the face shape chart below. Which face shape resembles yours the most?

## The Best Frames for Each Face Shape

Now that you’ve identified your face shape, it’s time to find a pair of glasses or sunglasses that make you look and feel incredible.

Remember, these tips are guidelines, not rules. If you love a particular frame, don’t let your face shape dictate your choice! Any glasses that make you feel confident are a win in our book.

### Glasses for Round Faces

For round face shapes, choose frames that add contrast with bold, angular lines. Here are some options:

- **Rectangular or Square Frames**: Sharpen your soft, curved features and create a longer, more slender appearance.
- **Geometric Frames**: Add balance and personality with distinct, angular shapes.
- **Upswept Frames**: Styles like cat-eye draw attention away from fuller cheeks and highlight your eyes.
- **Thick Browline Frames**: Complement full-bodied cheeks beautifully.

### Glasses for Oval Faces

Oval faces are the most common and versatile shape, allowing for a wide range of frame styles. The key is to choose glasses that are as wide as the widest part of your face (typically across your eyes or cheeks) to balance the length of your face. 
Here are some great options:

- **Rectangular or Square Frames**: These symmetrical styles complement well-proportioned features.
- **Cat Eye Frames**: Highlight your fabulous cheekbones with upswept designs.
- **Angular Frames**: Add uniqueness and contrast to the rounded parts of your face.
- **Aviator Frames**: Draw attention away from your forehead and towards your high cheekbones.

### Glasses for Heart-Shaped Faces

Heart-shaped faces offer versatility in frame options. To create balance, opt for styles with rounded bottoms and/or winged-out frames that are wider than your forehead. Consider these options:

- **Cat Eye Frames**: Shift focus away from the top of your face and balance your broad forehead with a narrow chin.
- **Oval or Round Frames**: Curved styles offset a narrow chin and draw attention upward.
- **Aviator Frames**: Add width and contrast to your features.
- **Browline Frames**: Highlight your facial features with semi-rimless designs.

### Glasses for Square Faces

For square faces, choose glasses with characteristics opposite to your angular features. Thinner, curved frames can soften defined angles. Here are some top choices:

- **Round Frames**: Lengthen and soften strong, angular features.
- **Oval Frames**: Balance out well-defined lines.
- **Cat Eye Glasses**: Complement sharp facial lines with a feline-inspired shape.
- **Wire Glasses**: Thin frames allow angular features to shine.

### Glasses for Triangular Face Shapes

Triangular faces are widest at the bottom and narrowest at the top. To create balance, select frames that are wider at the top and narrower at the bottom. Here are some good options:

![triangle](images/blog/trianglerec.png)


- **Cat Eye Frames**: Add contrast and complement your features with this upswept style.
- **Aviator Frames**: Bold on top and lighter on the bottom, ideal for highlighting your best features.
- **Browline Frames**: Draw attention away from your jawline and elongate your forehead.
- **Heavily-Accented Frames**: Add width to a narrow forehead with frames that feature bold colors and details at the top.

### Glasses for Diamond Faces

For diamond-shaped faces, look for frames that provide a softer contrast to your angular features. Consider these options:

![diamond](images/blog/diamondrec.png)


- **Round Frames**: Curved frames with gentle lines offset defined foreheads and chins.
- **Oval Frames**: Like round frames, they help balance the defined angles of a diamond face.
- **Browline Frames**: Thinner bottoms with thicker browlines suit angular features and defined cheekbones.
- **Cat Eye Frames**: Delicate styles enhance unique features without overpowering them.

## Other Factors to Consider When Buying Glasses

While the above details provide inspiration and direction, remember that these are recommendations, not strict rules. Face shape is just one factor in choosing new glasses. Here are the most important considerations:

- **Personal Style**: The beauty of having numerous options is the ability to express your unique aesthetic. Consider the look you want to achieve. For a classy and sophisticated vibe, rectangular or square frames are ideal. For a quirky look, explore round frames, geometric styles, colors, and prints.
  
- **Comfort**: Glasses should look great but also fit well. If they don’t feel good, you won’t wear them.

- **Facial Features**: Certain features can influence the style of glasses that suit you. For instance, if you have a low nose bridge, finding the right fit can be challenging, but there are options available!

Ultimately, the choice of frames is yours. Trust your instincts and use these recommendations as guidance to help you decide between multiple styles you like.
